    "# Text Summarization Evaluation Metrics Notebook\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Evaluating text summarization systems involves using various metrics to determine how well a machine-generated summary captures the key points of the original text. These metrics can be broadly classified into automatic metrics, which provide quantitative evaluations, and human evaluations, which offer qualitative insights.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 2. Automatic Metrics\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Automatic metrics use algorithms to compare the generated summaries with reference summaries. Here are some of the most commonly used metrics:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.1 ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "ROUGE is a set of metrics that measure the overlap between n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items from a given sample of text), word sequences, and word pairs in the generated summary and the reference summaries.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### ROUGE Variants:\r\n",
    "- **ROUGE-N**: Measures n-gram overlap. Examples include ROUGE-1 for unigrams and ROUGE-2 for bigrams.\r\n",
    "- **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS), capturing the longest series of words that appear in both the generated and reference summaries.\r\n",
    "- **ROUGE-W**: Measures the weighted LCS, giving higher scores to longer subsequences.\r\n",
    "- **ROUGE-S**: Measures skip-bigram, which considers pairs of words in the same order with arbitrary gaps.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.2 BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Originally developed for machine translation, BLEU can also be applied to text summarization. It measures the precision of n-grams in the generated summary compared to the reference summaries.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.3 METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "METEOR accounts for synonyms and stemming to provide a more nuanced comparison than BLEU. It evaluates unigram matches between the generated summary and the reference summary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.4 CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "CIDEr evaluates the generated summary by comparing it to multiple reference summaries using a consensus approach, emphasizing the importance of content that multiple references agree upon.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.5 BERTScore\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "BERTScore uses BERT embeddings to evaluate the similarity between the generated summary and reference summaries on a semantic level. It provides precision, recall, and F1-score based on cosine similarity of BERT embeddings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.6 SummaQA\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "SummaQA is based on question answering. It generates questions from the reference summaries and evaluates whether the generated summary can answer these questions, thus assessing the summary's content coverage and relevance.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2.7 Pyramid Method\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This human evaluation method involves identifying and weighting the information content (content units) in reference summaries. The generated summary is then evaluated based on the presence and importance of these content units.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 3. Content-Based Metrics\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Content-based metrics evaluate the content of the summary directly, focusing on the amount of important information retained, coverage, and redundancy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3.1 Information Content (IC)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Measures the amount of important information retained in the summary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3.2 Coverage\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Measures how much of the important content in the reference is covered by the summary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3.3 Redundancy\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Measures the amount of redundant information in the summary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 4. Readability Metrics\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Readability metrics assess the readability of the summary, ensuring that it is grammatically correct and easy to understand.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4.1 Flesch-Kincaid Readability Tests\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Measure the ease of reading a text based on sentence length and syllable count.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 4.2 Gunning Fog Index\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Estimates the years of formal education needed to understand the summary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 5. Human Evaluation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Human evaluation involves subjective assessment by human judges based on several criteria:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5.1 Fluency\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Is the summary grammatically correct and easy to read?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5.2 Coherence\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Does the summary logically flow and make sense?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5.3 Relevance\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Does the summary capture the important points of the original text?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 5.4 Conciseness\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Is the summary brief and to the point?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## 6. Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Different metrics provide different insights into the performance of text summarizers. Often, a combination of automatic metrics (like ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore) and human evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of summarization quality.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This notebook covers the primary metrics used in evaluating text summarizers, offering a structured approach to assess the performance of summarization systems comprehensively."
