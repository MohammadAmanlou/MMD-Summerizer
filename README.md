# MONI_NLP

**MONI_NLP** is a comprehensive repository designed to simplify and enhance the processes of text summarization and translation using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. This project integrates various models and user interfaces, such as Gradio and Streamlit, to provide a flexible, intuitive platform for handling text-related tasks. Additionally, it includes a Telegram bot to facilitate on-the-go summarization and translation.

## Features

### 1. **Text Summarization using Transformers**
- **Model:** The repository uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face to generate concise, coherent summaries of input text.
- **Interfaces:** 
  - **Gradio Interface**: Provides a straightforward user interface for quick summarization tasks.
  - **Streamlit Interface**: A more detailed application that allows for customization of summaries, including options like summary length, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

### 2. **Translation using MarianMT**
- **Models:** Translation tasks are handled by MarianMT (`Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-roa`), with support for other models.
- **Multilingual Support:** Translate text between multiple languages using models fine-tuned on various language pairs.
- **Interfaces:**
  - **Streamlit Application**: An advanced translation interface with flexible options for task management and language pair selection.

### 3. **Unified Summarization and Translation App**
- A combined Streamlit application integrates both summarization and translation workflows, with full customization options.
- **Support for Models:** Choose between summarization and translation or a combination of both using models like SeamlessM4T, Opus-MT, and MADLAD400.
- **Customizable Settings:** Adjust parameters like minimum/maximum summary length, target language for translation, and more.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Summarization:** Evaluate the quality of generated summaries using well-known metrics such as:
  - **ROUGE**
  - **BLEU**
  - **BERTScore**
  
### 5. **Telegram Bot Integration**
- **Bot Name:** [MONI_NLP_bot](https://t.me/MONI_NLP_bot)
- This Telegram bot provides quick access to the repositoryâ€™s summarization and translation capabilities, making it easy to handle text tasks on mobile devices.
